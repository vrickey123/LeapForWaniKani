# LeapForWaniKani
<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) is a Japanese-language-learning app that uses a Spaced Repitition System (SRS) to help users learn Japanese Kanji characters.

Leap For Wanikani is an open-source app developed by the community with three main features:

1. A Dashboard that syncs your current WaniKani lessons and reviews status to your device
2. Push notifications that alert you if you have pending lessons or reviews in your queue
3. An in-app browser that takes you directly to your lessons or reviews then back to the app's Dashboard

### Google Play
Leap For Wanikani is available for download on the [Google Play Store]().

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Technical
The app follows Android's standard MVVM (Model View ViewModel) architecture and implements a **main-safe repository layer with coroutines**. This means that asyncronous functions to request local or remote data use `suspend fun` instead of `LiveData` (or RxJava) in the repository and are only wrapped as obersvable `LiveData` in the `ViewModel`.

Let's look at the data flow for a [Summary](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/#summary) that backs our lessons and reviews cards as well as push notifications.

### Fragment (Make Request)
