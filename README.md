# Leap For WaniKani
<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) is a Japanese-language-learning app that uses a Spaced Repitition System (SRS) to help users learn Japanese Kanji characters.

Leap For Wanikani is an open-source app developed by the community with three main features:

1. A Dashboard that syncs your current WaniKani lessons and reviews status to your device
2. Push notifications that alert you if you have pending lessons or reviews in your queue
3. An in-app browser that takes you directly to your lessons or reviews then back to the app's Dashboard

### Google Play
Leap For Wanikani is available for download on the [Google Play Store]().

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Technical
The app follows Android's standard MVVM (Model View ViewModel) architecture and implements a **main-safe repository layer with coroutines**. This means that asyncronous functions to request local or remote data use `suspend fun` instead of `LiveData` (or RxJava) in the repository and are only wrapped as obersvable `LiveData` in the `ViewModel`.

Let's look at the data flow for a [Summary](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/#summary) that backs our lessons and reviews cards as well as push notifications.

### Fragment (Make Request)
Make a request to refresh our data (summary, assignments, etc.) from `DashboardFragment#onResume`.
```
override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        dashboardViewModel.refreshData()
    }
```

### ViewModel (Make Request)
Launch the request using the `DashboardViewModel#viewModelScope` that will cancel the coroutine automatically once the ViewModel's lifecycle owner (the Fragment) is destroyed.
```
fun refreshData() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _summary.value = waniKaniRepository.getSummary()
            ...
        }
    }
```

### Repository (Get Local or Remote)
The Repository layer is reponsible for returning local or remote data. Note that `WKApiResponse.ApiNotModified` returns local data. (See E-tags and Conditional Requests)

```
    override suspend fun getSummary(): LeapResult<WKReport.Summary> {
        return withContext(ioDispatcher) {
            return@withContext fetchSummaryRemoteOrLocal()
        }
    }
    
      private suspend fun fetchSummaryRemoteOrLocal(): LeapResult<WKReport.Summary> {
        val remoteSummary = wkRemoteDataSource.getSummaryAsync()
        when (remoteSummary) {
            is WKApiResponse.ApiError -> Log.w(TAG, "Remote summary source fetch failed")
            is WKApiResponse.ApiNotModified -> {
                return getSummaryFromLocal()
            }
            is WKApiResponse.ApiSuccess -> {
                refreshLocalSummary(remoteSummary.responseData)
                return LeapResult.Success(remoteSummary.responseData)
            }
            is WKApiResponse.NoConnection -> {
                return LeapResult.Offline
            }
            else -> throw IllegalStateException()
        }

        // Local if remote fails
        val localSummary = getSummaryFromLocal()
        if (localSummary is LeapResult.Success) return localSummary
        return LeapResult.Error(Exception("ApiError fetching summary from remote and local"))
    }

    private suspend fun getSummaryFromLocal(): LeapResult<WKReport.Summary> {
        return wkLocalDataSource.getSummary()
    }

    private suspend fun getSummaryRemote(): WKApiResponse<WKReport.Summary> {
        return wkRemoteDataSource.getSummaryAsync()
    }
```

#### Remote
`WKRemoteDataSource` wraps a retrofit `Response` with `WKApiResponse` to handle modified/not modified API responses.
```
interface WKRemoteDataSource {
    suspend fun getSummaryAsync(): WKApiResponse<WKReport.Summary>
}
```

The Retrofit `WaniKaniApi` implements network requests.
```
interface WaniKaniApi {
    @GET("summary")
    suspend fun getSummaryAsync():Response<WKReport.Summary>
}
```

#### Local
Async requests to a Room database are routed through `WKLocalDataSource` using `suspend` functions.
```
interface WKLocalDataSource {
    suspend fun getSummary(): LeapResult<WKReport.Summary>
}
```

```
interface WKReportDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM summary")
    suspend fun getSummary(): WKReport.Summary?
```

##### E-tags and Conditional Requests
The WaniKani API supports [conditional requests](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/#best-practices) with e-tags to determine whether or not a user's data has changed since the last time they made a reponse. 

If their data has not changed, a `304 Not Modified` response is returned to the app which significantly reduces mobile network usage by eliminating unecessary downloads.

### ViewModel (Observe Response)
The `LiveData<Summary` emits changes when the local or remote data source is triggered.
```
    val liveDataSummary: LiveData<LeapResult<WKReport.Summary>> =
        liveData {
            emitSource(_summary)
        }
```

### Fragment (Observe Response)
The `DashboardFragment` observes the `LiveData<Summary` and reacts when a new summary is emitted. It updates the UI based on a `LeapResult.Success`,`LeapResult.Error`, `LeapResult.Loading`, or `LeapResult.Offline` response so that a user's state is accurately represented.

```
dashboardViewModel.liveDataSummary.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, Observer { summary ->
            when (summary) {
                is LeapResult.Success<WKReport.Summary> -> {
                    // Lessons are grouped by the hour.
                    // [0] are the lessons available now, [1] are the lessons in an hour, etc. 24 hours provided.
                    adapter.bindAvailableStatus(availableStatus, summary.resultData.data.next_reviews_at)
                    adapter.bindLessonsCount(lessonsCardView, summary.resultData.data.lessons[0].subject_ids.size)
                    adapter.bindReviewsCount(reviewsCardView, summary.resultData.data.reviews[0].subject_ids.size)
                    progressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                }
                is LeapResult.Error -> {
                    progressBar.visibility = View.GONE
                    adapter.bindAvailableStatus(availableStatus, null)
                    adapter.bindLessonsCount(lessonsCardView, 0)
                    adapter.bindReviewsCount(reviewsCardView, 0)
                }
                is LeapResult.Loading -> {
                    progressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                }
                is LeapResult.Offline -> {
                    progressBar.visibility = View.GONE
                }
            }
        })
```
